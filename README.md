# HELLLO EVERYONE
This app will create playlist on your from 50 songs you listened recently on spotify.

It is based on Spotify API
In secret.py you need to put all of necessary values
# spotify_user_id you may find that in app

# HOWEVER things got complicated when you need to get spotify_token
 coz you'll need to take that from https://developer.spotify.com
 # When you apply for token be sure you have playlist-modify-public,playlist-modify-private and user-read-recently-played selected
